# Example config file /etc/vsftpd.conf

#

# The default compiled in settings are fairly paranoid. This sample file

# loosens things up a bit, to make the ftp daemon more usable.

# Please see vsftpd.conf.5 for all compiled in defaults.

#

# READ THIS: This example file is NOT an exhaustive list of vsftpd options.

# Please read the vsftpd.conf.5 manual page to get a full idea of vsftpd's

# capabilities.

#

#

# Run standalone? vsftpd can run either from an inetd or as a standalone

# daemon started from an initscript.

listen=NO
listen_ipv6=YES

pasv_enable=YES
pasv_min_port=21000
pasv_max_port=21010

local_enable=YES
write_enable=YES

# Default umask for local users is 077. You may wish to change this to 022,
# if your users expect that (022 is used by most other ftpd's)

local_umask=022

dirmessage_enable=YES

# If enabled, vsftpd will display directory listings with the time
# in your local time zone. The default is to display GMT. The
# times returned by the MDTM FTP command are also affected by this
# option.

use_localtime=YES

# Activate logging of uploads/downloads.
xferlog_enable=YES

#

# If you want, you can arrange for uploaded anonymous files to be owned by

# a different user. Note! Using "root" for uploaded files is not

# recommended!

#chown_uploads=YES
#chown_username=whoever

#

# You may override where the log file goes if you like. The default is shown

# below.

#xferlog_file=/var/log/vsftpd.log

#

# If you want, you can have your log file in standard ftpd xferlog format.

# Note that the default log file location is /var/log/xferlog in this case.

#xferlog_std_format=YES

#

# It is recommended that you define on your system a unique user which the

# ftp server can use as a totally isolated and unprivileged user.

#nopriv_user=ftpsecure

# You may fully customise the login banner string:
ftpd_banner=Welcome to ngonzale FTP service.

# You may restrict local users to their home directories. See the FAQ for
# the possible risks in this before using chroot_local_user or
# chroot_list_enable below.

chroot_local_user=YES

#
# You may specify an explicit list of local users to chroot() to their home
# directory. If chroot_local_user is YES, then this list becomes a list of
# users to NOT chroot().
# (Warning! chroot'ing can be very dangerous. If using chroot, make sure that
# the user does not have write access to the top level directory within the
# chroot)

chroot_list_enable=YES

# (default follows)

chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list


# This option should be the name of a directory which is empty. Also, the
# directory should not be writable by the ftp user. This directory is used
# as a secure chroot() jail at times vsftpd does not require filesystem
# access.

secure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty

#

# This string is the name of the PAM service vsftpd will use.

#
# This option specifies the location of the RSA certificate to use for SSL
# encrypted connections.
